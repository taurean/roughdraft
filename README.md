# Roughdraft

a never-ending roughdraft for a personal website

---

Roughdraft is built with 11ty. Some quick commands to get going:

1. `npm i`
2. `npm run start`
3. create a file named  `.env` in the root directory
4. add an env variable value for `SANITY_PROJECT_ID` and `SANITY_DATASET`
   * You can find this via the [Token Settings on Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/teams/personal/project/wlyiqeoa/settings#tokens)
5. … that should be it.
