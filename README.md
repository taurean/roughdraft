# Roughdraft

a never-ending roughdraft for a personal website

---

Roughdraft is built with 11ty. Some quick commands to get going:

1. `npm i`
2. create a file named  `.env.development` in the root directory
3. add an env variable value for `SANITY_PROJECT_ID` and `SANITY_DATASET`
   * You can find this via the [Sanity.io project details](https://manage.sanity.io)
4. `npm run start`
5. … that should be it.
